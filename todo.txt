Alignment Summary
Presentation Themes -> Status:

Core Value Proposition (Immediate alerts, preventative safety, trust networks, real-time awareness)

Backend groundwork largely present (alerts, groups, safe havens, risk alerts concepts in docs).
Frontend currently only has basic Home + Navbar; trust networks, watch mode, risk overlays, and safe haven UI not yet implemented.
Technical Excellence (Spring Boot, MongoDB, JWT, WebSocket /ws, geospatial)

Spring Boot backend running and health OK.
MongoDB usage implied; need to confirm collections and geospatial indexes in code (not yet verified).
JWT endpoints exist (docs mention /api/auth/login) but frontend integration not shown.
WebSocket path expected at /ws; frontend ECONNREFUSED indicates mapping or handshake mismatch (investigation pending).
Geospatial logic (safe havens, proximity) not surfaced in UI yet.
Demonstration Highlights (alert creation/response, safe haven navigation, group management, risk avoidance)

None of these flows are implemented on the current frontend; they are backend/domain concepts only.
Use Cases & User Scenarios (campus walk, family emergency, hiking, travel, elderly care, event safety)

Scenarios documented; app UI only covers landing page. Need dedicated flows/components (Watch Mode, Family Group dashboard, Group Map, Alert Panel, Safe Haven list, Risk Layer toggle).
Implementation Journey & Status

Docs claim “Core backend services implemented” & “API endpoints established”.
Frontend real-time and auth integration not yet started beyond styling.
Future Roadmap (AI risk prediction, wearables, voice, AR, international services)

All future; nothing built—safe to defer.
Technical Details (JWT, WebSocket STOMP topics, collections, scaling, security)

Need to confirm actual backend code implements: /ws endpoint, STOMP destinations (/user/queue/updates, /topic/group/{id}, etc.).
Need client STOMP configuration and token use.
Gaps & Actionable Tasks
Backend Verification:

Confirm existence and configuration of /ws endpoint and STOMP broker destinations.
Verify MongoDB collections and indexes (users, alerts, groups, safehavens, riskAlerts).
Check security config for JWT + WebSocket handshake filtering.
Frontend Feature Build (near-term):

Auth integration:
Login form; call /api/auth/login; store JWT; attach Authorization header.
WebSocket/STOMP client:
Connect to /ws with JWT.
Subscribe to /user/queue/updates and sample /topic/alerts to validate.
Alert creation UI:
Panic button component triggering POST /api/alerts (assumed).
Alert status panel (active, resolved).
Basic Map screen:
Leaflet map; overlay safe havens (mock fetch) & risk areas.
Display user location (browser geolocation).
Groups management:
Minimal create/list groups UI; add/remove member stubs.
Watch Mode:
Start/stop watch; periodic location send over WebSocket.
Supporting Enhancements:

Centralized design tokens applied to new components.
Loading/error state pattern (spinner + toast).
Shared API client wrapper with JWT injection.
WebSocket ECONNREFUSED Fix Path:

Step 1: Read backend WebSocket config file(s) (likely under backend/src/... WebSocketConfig).
Step 2: Align frontend URL: If server is on 8081 and dev proxy rewrites, ensure correct path (e.g., ws://localhost:3000/ws -> proxy -> 8081).
Step 3: Implement STOMP client with fallback/retry.
Step 4: Test subscriptions & message flow.
Testing & Validation:

Add minimal backend integration tests for WebSocket handshake if absent.
Frontend: create quick Jest test for API client token attach (if test setup exists).
Manual functional smoke: login → connect WS → trigger dummy alert → receive subscription message.
Documentation Updates:

Extend HOW_TO_RUN.md with WebSocket troubleshooting and first-time auth steps after implementation.
Add a ARCHITECTURE_FRONTEND.md summarizing planned UI modules aligned to presentation sections.
Suggested Immediate Next Steps (Order)
Inspect backend WebSocket and security config files to resolve /ws connection.
Implement frontend auth flow (login component + token storage).
Add STOMP client and verify a successful connection.
Build minimal Alert button + subscription to alert updates.
Introduce Map page with safe haven placeholders.
Document new steps.
